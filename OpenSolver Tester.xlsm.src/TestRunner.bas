' Test Runner for testing sheet.
' All tests should have the testing column as Column A on the sheet. These cells control the
' parameters for testing each sheet. There are two types of test:
'     - Normal, which is tested by the NormalTest.NormalTest function
'     - Custom, which is tested by a sheet-specific function called CustomTest.<SheetName>
'
' Model Type determines which solvers are tested on the problem - linear solvers are only tested on
' linear problems, while non-linear solvers are tested on all problems.
'
' Parameters specified in the testing column for Normal test:
'     - CorrectResult, takes value TRUE if solver output on sheet is as expected.
'     - ExpectedResult, specifies the OpenSolver code that should be returned.
